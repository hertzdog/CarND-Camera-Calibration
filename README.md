## Camera Calibration with OpenCV

The IPython notebook in this repository contains code to calculate the camera matrix and distortion coefficients using the images in the "calibration_wide" folder.

First of all I launched the notebook with:
jupyter notebook camera_calibration.ipynb

I starded to execute the initial code but a package was missing:
```bash
ImportError: No module named 'PyQt4'
```


Waiting for the paper with the chessboard :)
